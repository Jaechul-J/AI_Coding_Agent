Purpose of this project: Creating my own version of ChatGPT Copilot or Amazon Q equivalent

Sequence

1. Accespts a coding task (e.g. "strings aren't splitting in my app.. Please fix")
2. Chooses from a set of predefined functions to work on the task.
   - Scan the files in a directory
   - Readd a file's contents
   - Overwrite a file's contents
   - Execute a python interpreter on a file
3. Repeat step 2 until the task is complete (or it fails miserably, which is possible)

Takeaways from the project:

1. Multi-directory Python project
2. Understand how the AI tools that I'll most certainly use on the job actually work under the hood
3. Practice Python and functional programming skills
4. Not simply a response from trained data, but provide responses in live by either via API call or web browsing.
